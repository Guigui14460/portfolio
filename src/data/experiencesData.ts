        description: "I explored and visualized data from the production platform. From this, I then created a test simulator generating financial transactions in order to create Machine Learning models to verify the realism of this simulator. Then, I interpreted these models in order to continuously improve the simulator. Finally, I used Deep Learning techniques to go further in the realism analysis.",
