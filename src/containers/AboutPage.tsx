                <h3>My sentences</h3>
                <p>These few sentences define my life and work philosophy :</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>"Work hard, train as much as you can, and you won't find any goals that can't be accomplished by your hard work, experience and motivation"</li>
                    <li>"Work, fail, succeed. That's the best way to achieve your dreams."</li>
                </ul>
                <p>These different sentences have been a part of my life since I was little. When I lack motivation, I repeat these sentences to myself and it comes back even bigger !</p>
